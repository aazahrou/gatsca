# Scaphold GraphQL Backend as a Service

Scaphold is a Backend as a Service platform that was designed to help you rapidly develop,
deploy, and maintain data-driven applications. Every Scaphold application is, at its core,
a powerful GraphQL API that you can customize and extend to fit your workflow. As soon as you
create an application, we provision private storage and deploy it on our scalable architecture
hosted on AWS. Getting started is simple and this guide will walk you through what you need to
know to start being productive immediately.

## GraphQL First Design

Scaphold embraces a new application design paradigm called GraphQL first design. This is a
technique born from best practices that helps you create applications that are better prepared
for the changes that will undoubtedly come as your business needs grow. GraphQL-first design is
simple and revolves around one core component in your application, the schema.

Getting started building applications on Scaphold only takes a couple of minutes and normally
includes a couple of steps.

1. Define the GraphQL schema that embodies your application's data model. E.G. Slack might have
`Users`, `Teams`, `Channels`, and `Messages`.

2. Build your frontend application. Customers often build **React**, **React Native**,
**iOS**, **Android**, **IOT**, and **VR** applications.

3. Integrate popular services. In an instant add push notifications, search, monitoring and much more.

4. Expand functionality with custom business logic. Our logic system lets you pull in functionality
from microservices running on your own infrastructure.

These core building blocks allow you to rapidly create complete backend systems that can power
a wide variety of applications. This community page contains front-end starter kits that can help
you bootstrap applications for a variety of platforms as well as tutorials that show you how to
start implementing these powerful features in your own apps.
